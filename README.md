# dhcp-plus-base
Base image for dhcp-plus docker

# Abandoned
It actually kinda works after builtx into a docker but then I realised it looks really ugly.
So I switched to using my pihole-dot-doh docker instead since it has DHCP functionality.
Webmin is still superior because I still have to do nano edit of conf files with Pihole (instead of full GUI with Webmin) but if it works, it works.
